# Apy In

APYin is a web3 dashboard that allows users to quickly know the historical returns of their idle assets on the borrowing/lending markets. The web page requires a signature from the MetaMask wallet of the user to calculate the historical yield of all assets available on the wallet and for which a market exists. 

At first, APYin is purposefully built for the Aave protocol, but we plan to expand to other lending/borrowing platforms by comparing the weighted historical rates of all assets on the following platforms:

Aave
Compound
dYdX
Fulcrum
CREAM
Maker

The project is developed over 3 weeks time (Jan 15 - Feb 7) under the MarketMake hackathon organised by ETHGlobal and sponsored by Aave. We identify 3 main milestone and aim for the completion of each in 3 weekly sprints.

*Milestone 1 - Historical USD and % yield displayed to the user* 

MetaMask supported only
Aave supported only
Numerical information displayed only 

*Milestone 2 - Graphical information about the performance of each asset displayed to the user*

*Milestone 3 - TBD*
